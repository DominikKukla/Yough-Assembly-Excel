# Better Tomorrow for a Student from Greater Poland

A real-life project being conducted in liaise with the Youth Assembly of the Greater Poland Voivodeship, with the goal of improving the educational reality of Greater Poland students.

I was provided with the previously collected data from questionnaires filled out by students from various schools across Greater Poland.

Over the span of several weeks, I cleaned, analysed, and then forged this data into a comprehensive dashboard, which makes drawing conclusions from the previously provided responses a piece of cake.

## Overview

The core of this project is a highly polished seven-panel dashboard. Each segment delves into a slightly different aspect of school life, such as the atmosphere, mentality, or feelings of students.

Aside from bashborad, the Excel file contains the original dataset, a cleaned version of it including a dictionary, comprehensive EDA, and, of course, the dashboard's inner workings—the pivot table sheet—all of which are openly accessible.

## Stages of Development

- **Stage 1: Consultations** - This phase consisted of a few online meetings with a team from Yough Assembly to acquaint me with the project and emphasise the fundamental values that the completed dashboard should possess.

- **Stage 2: Data Cleaning** - Working with the survey data proved a formidable task and took an extensive amount of time due to the questionnaire's exceptional length, multiple-choice questions, and an abundance of open-ended questions, the responses to which had to be made uniform.

- **Stage 3: Data Analysis** - Extensive exploratory data analysis was performed in order to unravel key insights and other essential elements that ought to be featured on the dashboard.

- **Stage 4: Visualisation** - Finally, the fully-fletched interactive dashboard came to life, which facilitates drawing conclusions from the dataset in an appealing yet intuitive manner.

## Notices

**The whole project is fully in the Polish language.**

**The dashboard is meant to be looked at in full-screen mode without a formula bar, sheet tabs, or scroll bars.**
